# VGG-Re-Identification
This project is about face re-identification using VGG

The project needs Python 3 and Tensor-Flow's Keras API specification.

Necessary packages:
-numpy
-copy
-math
-scipy
-cv2

To run this project is necessary to download http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/src/vgg_face_matconvnet.tar.gz 
and put the folder in the Re-IdentificationVGG folder.
After that run VGG_CreateModel.py to create the VGG face model.
Run the re_id_euclidean.py in which it is possible to choose the video source, webcam or saved video (to quit the execution on
a video press 'q').
